Qualcomm CPR (Core Power Reduction) Regulator

CPR regulator device is for Qualcomm RBCPR (RapidBridge CPR) on
	application processor core. It takes voltage corner level
	as input and converts it to actual voltage based on the
	suggestions from factory production process. When CPR is
	enabled for application processer core, it will suggest
	scaling the voltage up or down for best performance and
	power of the core. The scaling based on factory production
	process is called PVS (Process Voltage Scaling) with efuse
	bits to indicate what bin (and voltage range) a chip is in.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,cpr-regulator"
- reg:				Register addresses for RBCPR and efuse
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "rbcpr" and "efuse_phys"
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator
- regulator-min-microvolt:	Minimum corner value as min constraint, which
				should be 1 for SVS corner
- regulator-max-microvolt:	Maximum corner value as max constraint, which
				should be 4 for SUPER_TURBO or 3 for TURBO
- qcom,num-efuse-bits:		The number of bits used in efuse memory to
				represent total number of PVS bins. It should
				not exceed a maximum of 5 for total number of
				32 bins.
- qcom,efuse-bit-pos:		A list of integers whose length must equal
				to qcom,num-efuse-bits and each integer indicates
				bit position in efuse memory from LSB to MSB
- qcom,pvs-bin-process:		A list of integers whose length is equal to 2 to
				the power of qcom,num-efuse-bits. The location or
				0-based index of an element in the list corresponds
				to the bin number. The value of each integer
				corresponds to the PVS process speed of the APC
				silicon for a chip with one of these cases:
					1 = APC_PVS_SLOW
					2 = APC_PVS_NOM
					3 = APC_PVS_FAST
					0 or other values = No PVS
- qcom,pvs-corner-ceiling-slow:	Ceiling voltages of all corners for APC_PVS_SLOW
- qcom,pvs-corner-ceiling-nom:	Ceiling voltages of all corners for APC_PVS_NOM
- qcom,pvs-corner-ceiling-fast:	Ceiling voltages of all corners for APC_PVS_FAST
				The ceiling voltages for each of above three
				properties may look like this:
				  0 (SVS voltage):		1050000 uV
				  1 (NORMAL voltage):		1150000 uV
				  2 (TURBO voltage):		1275000 uV
				  3 (SUPER_TURBO voltage):	1275000 uV
- vdd-apc-supply:		Regulator to supply VDD APC power


Optional properties:
- vdd-mx-supply:		Regulator to supply memory power as dependency
				of VDD APC.
- qcom,vdd-mx-vmax:		The maximum voltage in uV for vdd-mx-supply. This
				is required when vdd-mx-supply is present.
- qcom,vdd-mx-vmin-method:	The method to determine the minimum voltage for
				vdd-mx-supply, which can be one of following
				choices compared with VDD APC:
				  0 => equal to the voltage(vmin) of VDD APC
				  1 => equal to PVS corner ceiling voltage
				  2 => equal to slow speed corner ceiling
				  3 => equal to qcom,vdd-mx-vmax
				This is required when vdd-mx-supply is present.
